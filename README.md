## Task 1: Soil Image Classification

### Approach
- Used PyTorch with a pre-trained DenseNet for transfer learning.
- Applied data augmentations using `torchvision.transforms`.
- Split data into 80% training and 20% validation.
- Fine-tuned the model and retrained on the full dataset for better generalization.

### Challenges
- Faced class imbalance, with some soil types underrepresented.

### Solution
- Used weighted cross-entropy loss to assign higher penalties to minority class errors, improving prediction balance.

### Results
- Achieved an F1 Score of 1.0 on the public leaderboard.

## Task 2: Anomaly Detection (Soil vs Non-Soil)

### Approach
- Extracted semantic features using DINOv2 ViT-S/14.
- Trained a One-Class SVM using only soil images.
- Standardized features with `StandardScaler`.

### Challenges
- One-class training data made it difficult to model the decision boundary.

### Solution
- Used robust DINOv2 embeddings and tuned SVM hyperparameters (`nu`, `gamma`) to avoid overfitting.
- Applied feature normalization to improve model stability.

### Results
- Achieved a public leaderboard score of 0.9326.
